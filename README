The Solarized Theme for Matlab
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Append the contents to your Matlab .prf configuration file and restart Matlab.
On Windows 7 this is at:
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2011a\matlab.prf

Because Matlab doesn't offer highlighting rules for numbers, etc, this stays as close as possible to the Solarized theme.

Currently only the dark theme has been implimented.
